This project is a Bubble Sorting Visualizer that graphically represents the Bubble Sort algorithm in action. It allows users to visualize how the algorithm swaps elements in an array, using animated columns to represent values. The visualizer provides buttons to initialize, play, and pause the sorting process.

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Each element in the array is represented as a column with a height proportional to its value. As the sorting process takes place, the columns move and swap places according to the Bubble Sort algorithm.
